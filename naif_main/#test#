Many barred spiral galaxies show an excess in the (overall exponential) surface-brightness profile along the bar major-axis. However, the orbital support and main mechanism driving the evolution of this feature (shoulders) are not well understood. By means of frequency analyses in $N$-body simulations, we show that shoulders are produced by a subgroup of orbits at the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) with a ratio of vertical to radial oscillation frequencies $1 \lesssim \OmzR \lesssim 3/2$, in which orbits have loops at their ends. Whilst bars thicken, either secularly or by buckling, they bring obits from the (non-shoulder supporting) ratio $\OmzR > 3/2$ to this (shoulder-supporting) intermediate range, and later to $\OmzR<1$, towards the vertical ILR. Once crossing the vertical ILR, orbits gain vertical energy at the cost of in-plane motion, become chaotic, and less shoulder-supporting. This required intermediate range of $\OmzR$ explains why shoulders can be either created or erased soon after buckling events, and why shoulders should appear before BP-bulges. This evolution also explains why bars need to trap new orbits in order for shoulders to be present for long times, in accordance with the recently discovered need for a growing bar.
